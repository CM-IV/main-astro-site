**Disclaimer**: You aren't paying me to be your cybersecurity advisor, **do the following at your peril!**

The fine folks at [Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org) just announced their first release of a memory-safe version of `sudo` written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (their blog post announcing the milestone can be found [here](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/sudo-first-stable-release/)).  This development will ultimately lead to an entire class of bugs being avoided altogether or caught during compile time.  Let's test it out.

So I have spun up a Debian 12 virtual machine via [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and [Virtual Machine Manager](https://virt-manager.org/) for this test.  The `sudo` that comes with a Debian GNU/Linux distribution resides in the `/usr/bin` directory.  I'll be renaming both the `su` and `sudo` executables there to `su.disabled` and `sudo.disabled` here shortly, but first I'll clone the GitHub repository with SSH to the system: `git clone git@github.com:memorysafety/sudo-rs.git`.

The docs state that the MSRV for this project is `v1.70.0`, so you'll need to get that installed if you're a madman and want to follow along.  Issue a simple `cargo build --release` command to the terminal and after a few seconds I have the new memory-safe `su` and `sudo` binaries within the `/target/release` directory.  I'd like to issue a few commands here, first I'll fire off `sudo chmod u+s` for the respective binaries to set the `setuid` flag.  I then move the binaries to the `/usr/bin/local` directory with the `sudo` command.  Once this is done, I can make a bash alias to the sudo command that leads to the new memory-safe binaries.

Finally, I renamed the old `su` and `sudo binaries` to have a `.disabled` ending to them instead of outright deleting them.  Viola, you now have a memory-safe version of `sudo` ready to go.
