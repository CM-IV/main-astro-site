Check out *Glances* in order to monitor and keep track of your own homelab server.  I'm running this instance behind a Caddy reverse proxy, and I can access it through a Tailscale VPN.  The Caddy reverse proxy allows me to acquire TLS certificates for the VPN connection, even though they technically aren't needed.

This instance of Glances that is runnning a webserver will be used to supply data to an instance of *Dashy* that I will make a post about in the future.  That will be the cool frontend to this Glances data collection program that I am self-hosting.

Below this image is the docker-compose yaml file that I am using on my homelab in order to automate the docker container:

```yml
version: '3.3'
services:
    nicolargo:
        restart: always
        ports:
            - '61208-61209:61208-61209'
        environment:
            - GLANCES_OPT=-w
        volumes:
            - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro'
        pid: host
        image: docker.io/nicolargo/glances
```

This is all you'll need in order to get started collecting the data necessary for c reating a cool dashboard that keeps track of different metrics for your homelab.
