**Day 1**

DreamHack is a different world to me, as my friend and colleague introduced my to the entire concept of  professional gaming.  I was able to attain two tickets to the weekend-long event, and I made it into Dallas on the afternoon of the first day of the event (Friday, June 3rd).  The drive was not that bad, only a straight route on the freeway with the occasional stop for a gas refill and snacks/refreshments.

The first day inside of the Kay Bailey Convention Center was a sight to behold.  The main expo center itself was enormous, with multiple stages for each of the different venues.  One stage hosted the woman's CS-GO tournament while another stage hosted a lounge area where the different presenters could discuss their ideas and show them off to the public at the convention center.  Another stage hosted a Rocket-League tournament where the crowd went wild after each goal was scored.
