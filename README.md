# Oceanus Digital Consulting
## Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Here's a rough outline of the directory structure.

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
|   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ styles.css
|   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ blogPost.astro
|   |   â””â”€â”€ mainLayout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
